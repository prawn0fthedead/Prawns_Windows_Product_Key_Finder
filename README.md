<h1>Prawn's Windows Product Key Finder</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This is a tool designed to retrieve the Windows product key from either your local/current computer or an external OS drive by searching its Windows Registry, and retrieving the product key.

This is a simple program, just download and run. No bloatware, no fancy stuff, no cost, it's free and (hopefully) easy to use. 
If you have any suggestions for it, put it in the <a href="https://github.com/prawn0fthedead/Prawns_Windows_Product_Key_Finder/issues">Issues</a> tab.

<b>Note</b>: This has only been tested for Windows 10, so Windows 11 and/or other versions may not work.

Some example use-cases for retrieving the product key:
<ul>
  <li>Backing up your Windows version key</li>
  <li>Migrating the same Windows version from a dead or old PC</li>
  <li>Windows 11 Pro gives a free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, if you need the key for that but have it on another system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Releases</h2>
Currently there's only one release, and any future releases will either be for compatibility with future Windows versions, or improvements to the UI.
Releases can be found in the Releases tab <a href="https://github.com/prawn0fthedead/Prawns_Windows_Product_Key_Finder/releases">here</a>. Just download the .exe file and run.
